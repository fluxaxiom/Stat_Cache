## What does this code do? ##

The code runs on a sensor equipped Arduino Mega and writes data to an SD card. The code also contains control of an led light to aid in video sync.

There are other uses for the project that I might explore, but right now its purpose is to sync data with video for the purpose of adding a HUD dashboard effect to motion sports videos.
