## What does this code do? ## 

The code runs on a sensor equipped Arduino Mega and writes data to an SD card. The code also controls an led light to aid in video sync.

The intention is to sync the data captured by this device with video for the purpose of adding a HUD dashboard effect to motion sports videos.
